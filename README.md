# coding-refactor is my first challenge in class that is focussed on taking a real life situation and trying to run with it. In said situation I have been given tyhe base code and I am refactoring it to meet better standards.
# as such the live url for this project is https://colevibes.github.io/coding-refactor/ for reference.
